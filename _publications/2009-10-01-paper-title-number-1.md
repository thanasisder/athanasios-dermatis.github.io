excerpt: 'Wave breaking is widely recognized as a very challenging phenomenon to emulate usingnumerical/computational methods. On that condition, the transition from modelling regular toirregular breaking waves is not trivial. Even though some issues are surpassed in CFD simulations,there still are two substantial problems to account for. The first one entails the proper generationof irregular waves in a numerical wave tank, while the second is the introduction of the turbulentregime of breaking in the solver. The present work addresses these two problems by employingthe Stabilized k − ω SST model for turbulence closure and by proposing an efficient and accuratemethod for irregular wave generation. Apart from that, an artificial compressibility method is usedfor coupling the system of equations, which solves these equations in a non-segregated mannerand overcomes problems pertaining to the existence of the interface in free-surface flows. Themethodology is validated through the test case of irregular wave propagation over a submergedbreaker bar and a piecewise sloped bottom, indicating the ability of the method to capture irregularbreaking wave phenomena. Simulations are in fair agreement with experimental data regardingenergy spectra and free surface time-series, while results suggest that the known over-prediction ofturbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is significantly constrained by the Stabilized k − ω SST model'
